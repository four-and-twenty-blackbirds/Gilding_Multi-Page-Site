			<h3>Definition</h3>
			<p>
				Strictly speaking, an “illuminated” manuscript contains gold or silver,
				which reflects the light. A manuscript richly decorated in color only,
				without actually having gold or silver is, technically, not illuminated.
			</p>
			<p>
				Gold leaf is not especially easy to use either. It is a property of gold
				that, unlike many other metals, it can be hammered thinner and thinner
				without ever crumbling away. A piece of gold leaf is infinitely thinner
				than the thinnest paper. It is virtually without thickness and has
				almost no weight.
			</p>

			<h3>Application</h3>
			<p>
				If gold leaf is to be applied to a design in a manuscript it is put on
				before the paint. This is crucial for two reasons:
			</p>
			<ul class="list-control">
				<li>
					Gold will adhere to <em>any pigment</em> that has already been laid on
					the parchment or paper, ruining the design.
				</li>
				<li>
					The act of burnishing gold leaf is <em>vigorous</em>, and runs the
					risk of smudging any painted areas already around it.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				One method to apply gold leaf is to brush down an adhesive medium that
				works with gold leaf, such as glair or gum, then apply the gold leaf on
				top. Once it is dry, it can be left dull or burnished to a bright shine.
			</p>
			<p>
				A second method is to apply a sticky gesso which builds on top of the
				page. The gold is then applied, allowed to dry, and can be polished,
				giving it a three-dimensional look. The effect of the thick, curved
				edges allows light to catch from many angles at once. In some cases, the
				added gesso enabled the gilded surface to be tooled into intricate
				designs.
