			<h1>Gilding</h1>
			<p>
				<strong>Gilding</strong> is the application of thin sheets of gold (or
				silver) to a surface. It was more frequently applied in medieval
				illumination, in the form of gold leaf, but was also applied to other
				objects.
			</p>
			<p>
				Gilding formed the <em>first</em> stage in the painting process of
				illumination. Since it was a messy activity, the gilded area often
				required trimming with a knife. The gilding of a manuscript illustration
				was carried out by the artist or by a specialist.
